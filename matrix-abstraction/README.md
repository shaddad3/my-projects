In this project I define a class, mymatrix<T>, which is desgined to support a 2D data structure that can grow dynamically in terms of rows and columns. The matrix is able to grow in this way because it is implemented using pointers to C-style arrays. In the matrix class many different member functions are defined and implemented with the same C-style arrays in mind. Finally, there is a file containing all the test cases used to ensure that the matrix class works correctly, all the member functions work as intended, and that the matrix class works with different kinds of data types.
