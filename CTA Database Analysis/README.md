This folder contains the Python CLI program to analysis the CTA ridership database! In main.py I analyze CTA ridership, utilizing SQL to retrieve & evaluate the data, and Python to display insightful results such as station info, ridership trends, & other statistical calculations, as well as employed Matplotlib for data visualization, displaying dynamic graphs, plots, and maps of Chicago.

Also in this folder is another prokect containing an analysis of a Chicago lobbyist database! This project uses 3 "tiers" to showcase how an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) can be used to not only clean up a program (instead of having everything in a single file) but also make it easier to use and integrate with other projects. The 3 tiers are an object, data, and presentation tier (main).
