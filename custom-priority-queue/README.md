In this project I create a custom priorityqueue class in C++. The design of a priority queue is that regardless of the order you add elements to the queue, you remove the elements with the lowest priority first (most urgent) and highest priority last (least urgent). The priority queue I created is implemented with a custom binary search tree (BST) that allows duplicates. Along with all the standard member functions of a queue (enqueue, dequeue, size, etc) the priorityqueue class has an iterator function called begin and next, which allows the user to go through the queue without destroying it. Additionally, there is a file containing all the test cases used to ensure that the priorityqueue class works correctly, all the member functions work as intended, and that the priorityqueue class works with different kinds of data types.
