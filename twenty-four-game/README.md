TwentyFour is a game in which the player is presented 4 numbers that they must try to combine in a way that yields 24. In this project, I created a C program that resembles TwentyFour, where the user is asked to select the difficulty that they wish to play, and then are given 4 numbers to try to yield 24. The numbers can be combined in any order and parentheses are allowed to make expressions more precise. The program is implemented using a stack data structure, which helps with the evaluation of parentheses. Since C does not have a built in stack data structure, I used a linked list to model the stack.
