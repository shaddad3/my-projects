In this project I created a C program that resembles the game Weaver. In Weaver, you are presented with a starting word and an ending word, and you must get to the ending word by only changing the starting word by 1 character at a time. On top of the 1 character change limit, each word also must be a valid dictionary word to be accepted. In my program, you have an unlimited amount of attempts to get from the starting to ending word. Weaver is typically played with only 4 letter words, but in my program you may play with words of varying length. Finally, the program is implemented using a 2D array to store all the possible dictionary words for each iteration of the game, and uses dynamic memory allocation to free up the memory after the game is finished.
